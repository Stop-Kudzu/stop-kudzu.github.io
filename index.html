<h1>Stopping The Kudzu Invasion</h1>

  <h2>KUDZU IS DESTROYING YOUR TREES. WILL YOU STOP IT?</h2>
 
  <h3><em>What is Kudzu?</em>

    <p>Kudzu is a vine that originally came from Asia, specifically Eastern Asia (Japan, China, etc.), but settled well into many ecosystems
  here in the USA. It lives by grabbing onto a larger plant, and using it to gain sunlight. In doing so, the Kudzu eventually smothers 
  its host tree, killing it.<br> </p>
    
    <h3><em>How To Stop It</em><h3>
      
      <p>Kudzu, though hardy, can be harvested using sharp implements. A problem with cutting kudzu is that it can regrow extremely fast, as much as one foot in a single day.</p>
