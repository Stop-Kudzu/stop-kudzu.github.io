  <h2>KUDZU IS DESTROYING YOUR TREES. WILL YOU STOP IT?</h2>
 
  <h2><em><strong>What is Kudzu?</strong></em></h2>

    <p>Kudzu is a vine that originally came from Asia and some Pacific islands, specifically Eastern Asia (Japan, China, etc.), 
      but settled well into many ecosystems here in the USA. It lives by grabbing onto a larger plant, and using it to gain sunlight. 
      In doing so, the Kudzu eventually smothers its host tree, killing it. Kudzu, in the U.S., is commonly found in the southeastern 
      states, but has also been found in certain areas of Oregan, Washington, and even parts of California.<br> </p>
     
      <p>Kudzu can grow to many meters long. It spreads quickly, and can kill large trees off. The best time for harvesting Kudzu is in
        the winter, because the rate of growing is greatly diminished.</p>

    <h2><em><strong>How Do You Stop It?</strong></em></h2>
      
      <p>Kudzu, though hardy, can be harvested using sharp implements. A problem with cutting kudzu is that it can 
        regrow extremely fast, as much as one foot in a single day.To kill it, you can dig up the roots, which will prevent growth, or if you are in possesion of herbivores, or there are many nearby,
   you can allow animals to graze on it.</p>

       <p>Kudzu Bugs are relatives to the stinkbug. They are commonly found on kudzu vines, and are known to commonly invade nearby houses. 
         When crushed, they emit a brown liquidy substance and a terrible smell. The remnants that may have gotten on any skin
         are known to cause allergic reactions.</p>
